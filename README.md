# WizardsGlovesAdventure

For the R&D course in our masters study ICT and electronics engineering we developed a game with additional tangibles.

The game itself is a adventure game where you play as a person with wizarding gloves. Throughout the game you well be able to make choices which will lead you to further levels. The tangible is a set of gloves which are fit with experimental foam pressure sensors and IMU sensors for movement awareness. The game is fully interfaced by the gloves.
